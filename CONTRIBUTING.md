## How to Contribute?

### Raising an issue:
For now the members of technical team will be creating the issues for the interested members to work on. But as this is an Open Source project and we would be happy to see contributors who report bugs and file feature requests submitting pull requests as well. So after sometime anyone and everyone are allowed to create issues and send in pull requests.
 
### Sending pull requests:

- ####  You can either use Android Studio in-built Version Control System.

- ####  Or you can use the basic git-bash commands to work.
